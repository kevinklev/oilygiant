# Oilygiant

In this project, I am tasked with identifying the most profitable oil well location for OilyGiant mining company by analyzing geological data from three different regions. The project involves building a linear regression model to predict the volume of reserves for each oil well based on its parameters, such as oil quality and reserve volume. Using these predictions, I will select the most promising wells and determine the region that offers the highest total profit potential. The analysis will incorporate the Bootstrapping technique to evaluate potential profits and associated risks, ensuring the final decision adheres to the company's requirement of maintaining a risk of loss below 2.5%. The goal is to maximize return on investment by choosing the optimal region for new oil well development while satisfying specific business constraints.

For each region under consideration, an initial pool of 500 potential sites will be evaluated to select the top 200 with the most promising oil reserves for profit calculation. The allotted budget for developing these 200 wells is set at 100 million. Economically, each barrel of oil is expected to generate $4.5 in revenue, with the understanding that the oil reserve volumes are measured in thousands of barrels, making the revenue from one unit of product 4,500. Post risk assessment, only those regions with a loss risk under 2.5% will be considered for development. Among these, the region with the highest average profit will be chosen as the site for new oil well development.
